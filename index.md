I am a Computer Science researcher working with [Intelligent Robotics](https://intelligentrobotics.org) and the [University of Florida](http://www.reef.ufl.edu). My research focuses on Perception and Computer Vision in Robotics. 


I am an alumnus of [Florida State University](http://www.cs.fsu.edu) and [STRIDE](http://www.eng.fsu.edu/stride) where I earned my Masters degree in Computer Science. 


I use this website to keep a record of [ideas](pages/recent.html) I work on.
I am also an avid outdoorsman, always in search of my next adventure. Feel free to check my [travel](pages/travel.html) diary.
