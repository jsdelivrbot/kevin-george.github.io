I am a Computer Scientist working with [Kindred.ai](https://kindred.ai). My research focuses on Robotics, including Perception & Manipulation. 


I am an alumnus of [Florida State University](http://www.cs.fsu.edu) and [STRIDE](http://www.eng.fsu.edu/stride) where I earned my Masters degree in Computer Science.


I use this website to keep a record of [ideas](pages/recent.html) I work on.
I am also an avid outdoorsman, always in search of my next adventure. Feel free to check my [travel](pages/travel.html) diary.  


I am reachable at **kevin dot george at protonmail dot com**
