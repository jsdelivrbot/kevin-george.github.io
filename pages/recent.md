#### [Grab Yo Umbrella](https://github.com/kevin-george/grab_yo_umbrella)
Everyone living in Florida knows it's bipolar so I wrote a simple script that would check the weather and text me if I needed to have an umbrella handy. The script needs to be configured using the yaml file present in the repository. The script can also be modified for other information one is interested in like wind speed(kiteboarders), temperature lows/highs etc.
