#### [Get Yo Umbrella](https://github.com/kevin-george/get_yo_umbrella)
Living in Florida forced me to always keep an eye out for the weather. But it can get tiring and as always I ask myself, can this be automated?
The result of this line of thought was a simple script that would check the weather and text me if I needed to have an umbrella handy. I know, the lazy go out of their way to simplify the silliest of things.

The script can be configured using a yaml config file. I have only tested this in the US where texts can be forwarded by one's carrie if one follows a particular format to send an email(details can be found in the yaml). 

I hope to spend a lot more time on personal projects this coming year :)
