#### [Computer Vision Tools](https://github.com/kevin-george/cv_tools)
Since I started exploring Computer Vision, I have written many scripts to accomplish common tasks using OpenCV and other frameworks. In order to share this work with others and have a useful toolbox for myself, I have created this repository.

#### [Grab Yo Umbrella](https://github.com/kevin-george/grab_yo_umbrella)
Everyone living in Florida knows the weather here is unpredictable so I wrote a simple script that would check the weather and text me if I needed to have an umbrella handy. The script needs to be configured using the yaml file present in the repository. The script can also be modified for other information one is interested in like wind speed(kiteboarders), temperature lows/highs etc. More details on usage and implementaion can be found in the README.
