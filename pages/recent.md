#### [Computer Vision Tools](https://github.com/kevin-george/cv_tools)
One ends up using a common set of tools when working with Computer Vision to solve a problem. This repository serves to be a toolbox of sorts and contains scripts I have written over the years to help with my research.

#### [Grab Yo Umbrella](https://github.com/kevin-george/grab_yo_umbrella)
Everyone living in Florida knows the weather here is unpredictable so I wrote a simple script that would check the weather and text me if I needed to have an umbrella handy. The script needs to be configured using the yaml file present in the repository. The script can also be modified for other information one is interested in like wind speed(kiteboarders), temperature lows/highs etc. More details on usage and implementation can be found in the README.
